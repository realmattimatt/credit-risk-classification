## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers using historical lending data. By leveraging logistic regression, we aim to classify loans as either low-risk (0) or high-risk (1) based on various borrower characteristics.

The analysis involves:
* Preprocessing: Splitting data into training and testing sets.
* Model Training: Implementing a logistic regression classifier.
* Evaluation: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
* Recommendation: Determining whether the model is suitable for real-world use.

## **Results**
Accuracy: XX%
Precision: XX%
Recall: XX%
Confusion Matrix: [Insert results]

* Machine Learning Model 1: SAMPLE
    * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores. SAMPLE

## **Summary**
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example: Sample

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )
* SAMPLE

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning. SAMPLE


## **Technologies / Dependencies Needed and Used**
- **Numpy**: NumPy enables efficient numerical computations, data transformations, and integration with machine learning models, supporting fast array operations and statistical functions.
- **Pandas**: Used for handling and analyzing large datasets, particularly in tabular form (e.g., DataFrames).
- **hvplot.pandas**: Used for interactive plotting in Python, specifically designed to work seamlessly with Pandas DataFrames. It allows you to create interactive plots directly from your data, enhancing visualization capabilities.



## **How to Run the Application**
- 1. Install Technologies / Dependencies Needed and Used. See - [**Sources**](#sources) for additional information.
- 2. Open and run the jupyter notebook top to bottom.
