## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers using historical lending data. By leveraging logistic regression, we aim to classify loans as either low-risk (0) or high-risk (1) based on various borrower characteristics.
### **The analysis involves:**
* Preprocessing: Splitting data into training and testing sets, then applying feature scaling using `StandardScaler` to normalize input data and improve model performance.
* Model Training: Implementing a logistic regression classifier.
* Evaluation: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
* Recommendation: Determining whether the model is suitable for real-world use.

## **Results**
- **Accuracy**: 99.37%
- **Precision (High-Risk Loans)**: 84%
- **Recall (High-Risk Loans)**: 94%
  
- **Confusion Matrix**:
  -  **True Negatives (TN)** = 18,652 → Correctly predicted healthy loans.
  - **False Positives (FP)** = 113 → Healthy loans misclassified as high-risk.
  - **False Negatives (FN)** = 9 → High-risk loans misclassified as healthy.
  - **True Positives (TP)** = 610 → Correctly predicted high-risk loans.


- **Machine Learning Model 1: Logistic Regression**
    * The logistic regression model was trained on scaled data using `StandardScaler` to normalize feature values.
    * **Accuracy**: 99.37% – The model correctly classified most loans.
    * **Precision (High-Risk Loans)**: 84% – When the model predicts a loan is high-risk, it is correct 84% of the time.
    * **Recall (High-Risk Loans)**: 94% – The model correctly identifies 94% of actual high-risk loans.
    * The confusion matrix suggests that the model is slightly biased toward classifying loans as **healthy**, leading to a small number of misclassified high-risk loans.


## **Summary**
The logistic regression model performed well with an **overall accuracy of 99.37%**, but it showed **slight bias towards classifying loans as healthy**.  

### **Key Takeaways:**
- The model achieves **high recall (94%)** for high-risk loans, meaning it successfully identifies most of them.
- However, its **precision (84%)** suggests it sometimes misclassifies **healthy loans as high-risk**.
- **Depending on the business goal**, this model may be useful if catching high-risk loans is a priority, even at the cost of some false positives.

### **Recommendation:**
- If the primary goal is **identifying high-risk loans**, this model performs well.
- If **minimizing false alarms** (misclassified healthy loans) is critical, tuning the classification threshold or trying **a different model (e.g., Random Forest)** could improve results.



## **Technologies / Dependencies Needed and Used**
- **Numpy**: NumPy enables efficient numerical computations, data transformations, and integration with machine learning models, supporting fast array operations and statistical functions.
- **Pandas**: Used for handling and analyzing large datasets, particularly in tabular form (e.g., DataFrames).
- **hvplot.pandas**: Used for interactive plotting in Python, specifically designed to work seamlessly with Pandas DataFrames. It allows you to create interactive plots directly from your data, enhancing visualization capabilities.


## **How to Run the Application**
1. **Install Dependencies**: See [**Sources**](#sources) for additional information.
2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**: Open and run all cells from **top to bottom** in the following notebook:
