## **Project Overview**
SAMPLE

## **Results**
Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1: SAMPLE
    * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores. SAMPLE

## **Summary**
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example: Sample

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )
* SAMPLE

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning. SAMPLE


## **Technologies / Dependencies Needed and Used**

- **Numpy**: NumPy enables efficient numerical computations, data transformations, and integration with machine learning models, supporting fast array operations and statistical functions.
- **Pandas**: Used for handling and analyzing large datasets, particularly in tabular form (e.g., DataFrames).
- **hvplot.pandas**: Used for interactive plotting in Python, specifically designed to work seamlessly with Pandas DataFrames. It allows you to create interactive plots directly from your data, enhancing visualization capabilities.



## **How to Run the Application**
- 1. Install Technologies / Dependencies Needed and Used. See - [**Sources**](#sources) for additional information.
- 2. Open and run the jupyter notebook top to bottom.
